# Subscriptions REST Service

The aim of the project is to design and develop a Subscription API. This service will allow users to sign up for a specified newsletter and receive personalised emails. 

The subscription service interacts with two more internal services: the event and email services. The event service it will be used to create new newsletters and list the existing ones. Finally, the second service sends a personalised email to subscribers of an specified newsletter. 

The project contains a unit test collection using JUnit to validate and ensure that code meets its design and behaves as intended.

## Requirements to build the application

* Java SE Development Kit 1.8 or later
* Apache Maven 3.0+


## Build and run
* Download the repository with the source code using git:

	`git clone https://github.com/ARecuenco92/subscriptions-rest-service.git`

* Compile the source code, run tests, and package the code up in a JAR file with Maven:

	`mvn package`

* Execute the application and the embedded Server will start, deploy the services and listen on port 8080:

	`java -jar target/subscriptions-rest-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

* Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

* See the subscription API and interact with it using Swagger UI
